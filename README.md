**IPAM and VPC Provisioning with IPv6**
Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the setup of an AWS VPC with IPv4 and IPv6 support, utilizing AWS IPAM (IP Address Management) for efficient address allocation and management. The configuration dynamically provisions subnets, associates IPv6 CIDR blocks, and ensures robust network setup across availability zones.

**Key Features**
AWS IPAM Integration: Managed IP address allocation for IPv6 CIDR blocks.

Dual Stack VPC: IPv4 and IPv6 coexistence for flexibility and scalability.

Dynamic Subnet Creation: Automated provisioning of subnets across availability zones.

Resource Dependency Management: Ensures proper ordering with depends_on.

Technologies Used
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform

Cloud Provider: AWS
